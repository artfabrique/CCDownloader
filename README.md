Download from Creative Cloud Libraries

CreativeCloud has this magical thing called a "Library", but you can't download from them (???)

This tool lets you do that

##Â How to use

1. clone, `npm install`
2. run `node server.js`
3. open http://localhost:8080
4. if you get redirected to adobe.com?code=... then you need to change adobe.com to localhost:8080/auth
5. browse and download files

This at least works with Adobe Shape
